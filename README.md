# **Petrichor**

Petrichor is an app made for people who are looking for alternative medicine. 

Users will be able to click on their ailment, and see the list of herbs they would like to purchase. 

## Technology and Languages Used:
React, JSX, MongoDB, Mongoose

## Approach and Process:
This was my first project made with React. I really struggled with this project, and there is still some functionality that are not working. 

My thought and design process looked somewhat like this:

IDEA -> APP NAME -> WIREFRAME -> ROUTES/API -> FRONTEND -> TEST -> CSS 


## Future Improvements/Considerations to Include

    * Order Page
    * Full functionality
